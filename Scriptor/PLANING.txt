plans for Scriptor:

	will probalby be more useful as a kind of markuplanguage,
	except its actually capable of executing code.
	so for example the markup could save data describing a box: width, height and depth,
	but it could also save width * height * depth as volume, so when the script executes we get the volume aswell

	better example:
		saving a gamelevel where you want the enemys to always have a random position
		or props (like trees and rocks) to be spawned with random sizes

Terms:
	Command - something that executes
	Expression - a Command that evaluates to a value
